## Application Idea Descriptions

Note: any reference to "app" means a form of web app, not a phone app (although will be structured to allow extensibility into a phone app in the future).

### Language: 
 - Overview: self-note taking app — algorithm during review mode (for each section, pages need for most review)
 - PROS: 
   - cool algorithm — generates which pages to review
   - user-built experience (input supplied by user)
   - interface can be pretty basic
 - CONS: 
   - heavy content-based (guide)
   - languages
   - translation in both directions
   - data for human-based interaction
 - IDEAS: 
   - modularize your notes — entirely for language
     - conjugation modules
     - vocab modules
     - grammar modules
     - pronunciation modules?
   - google translate functionality?
   - one chapter == one page
   - sections: literature, vocabulary, grammar, auditory
   - time function (given a set amount of time, tells how much should spend)
   - machine learning — for user-built experience
   - comparator ranking method to determine which pages to review the most based on time, difficulty, and ability
   - “insert conjugation table” & “insert vocabulary”
   - each section of GUI has distinct aesthetic
   - demo: presented in English (intended for english audience for the demo)
### Hand-Me-Down:
 - Overview: connect students to pass down old or unused items
   - PROS:
     - demo
     - filtering (clothes, furniture, books, stationary)
     - sustainability oriented
     - promoting reuse of different things
   - CONS: 
     - content-based
     - security
     - sleaziness or deceit may be an issue
   - IDEAS: 
     - use google, facebook, id sign-in
     - filtering system - user sustained input
     - search functionality for specialization
     - request system?
     - database heavy (construction & management)
     - directness
     - targeted towards students
     - transaction process: “drop-off,” “pick-up,” “meet in middle”
       - campus-based (local) — central location for drop-off
     - distinct aesthetic
     - look at etsy for inspiration
   - PROCESS:
     - buyer - seller interaction: seller supplies content instead of buyer requests
     - feed of listings as well as feed of requests?
       - complete request, item in feed matches
     - cross-checking between feeds (independence between the two, but if there is a match — people are notified?)
     - handling multiple things from the same person?
       - exchange object listing what is being exchanged
       - purchase page (receipt)
     - post-transaction page (confirmation page)
### Anxiety: 
 - Overview: organized system (wikipedia?) — simple to use, user-contribution — authentication by those with authority, detailed / summarized explanations
   - PROS: 
     - people add own data
     - crowd-sourced
     - reward system for exploration and growth
       - Reward system also serves to show developers data on what’s working and what isn’t
       - sharing with friends
   - CONS: 
     - content-based (guide)
     - setting a level-of-quality
     - incentivization
     - marketing towards a very focused and specific audience
   - IDEAS: 
     - game (fidget game)
     - report functionality — survey-esque
       - flagging — cw’s
     - generic & specific
       - how to go to a specific restaurant and how to go to that specific restaurant in this region
     - ensure diversity in data
     - moderators — how is this defined though?
       - common pages: determined based by contributions
       - demo maybe unnecessary
     - forum aspect — social and interactive (meet friends with anxiety)
     - allowed sign-in but can opt out (allow anonymous sign-in)
       - sign-up with google: but hide information
       - allow for anonymity but not make it forced
       - wholesome avatars
     - reporting systems
   - USE-CASES:
     - trains, planes, and automobiles
     - neuro-divergence and other sorts of mental illnesses
       - directed towards guides instead of anxiety itself
